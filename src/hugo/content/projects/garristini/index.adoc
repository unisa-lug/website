born with the intention to form an informal community made up by an increasing
number of technician and academic students exploiting the resources of

We have a very simple mandate: +
leveraging the bleeding-edge infrastructures provided by GARR to foster our
knowledge in a wide range of ICT technologies like:
Networking, Infrastructure management, GitOps, Security, â€¦and lots of other 
things.

The community welcomes any academic student, with any level of expertise,
who is interested in the covered topics. +

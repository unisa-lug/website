== External

- The GARRistini project: a collaboration with GARRLab +
GARRLab is an informal community made up by an increasing number of technician
and students who are somehow related to GARR - our Italian NREN.
+
We have a very simple mandate: leveraging the bleeding-edge infrastructures
provided by GARR to foster our knowledge in a wide range of ICT technologies
(networking, system and network infrastructure management, 
cloud-based CI/CD git-assisted - aka: GitOps, system and network security,
â€¦and lots of other things).
+
Our mission is simple: simplify our daily work (we, technicians) and put our
hands on top-knotch systems and equipments (we, students)
